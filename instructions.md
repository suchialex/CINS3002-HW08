    Assignment Instructions
  </summary>

- In this assignment we manage employee data using classes and objects in a complex dictionary
- Each employee has four data elements - Name, Department, Salary, Email
- That data will be stored in an object
- All such objects for each employee is stored in a dictionary whose keys will be the employee ID we calculate
</details>


## Start Working

<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Create a new PyCharm project
  </summary>

  - Create a new PyCharm project in a folder of your choice
  - Create a Python file - main.py
  - Inside the project create a new folder **hw08**
  - Create files classes.py, class_functions.py and validations.py
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Copy code from hw06
  </summary>

  - Copy main.py
  - Copy the code in validations.py from HW07
  - Change the import statement in main.py to use class_functions module
</details>

## In classes.py

<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Define a class called employee
  </summary>

  - Use coding conventions for class name
</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Define __init__() for the employee class
  </summary>

  - Because our employee has four data fields, accept for parameters in the \_\_init\_\_ definition
</details>

## In dict_functions.py

<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Import the employee class
  </summary>

  - Using the from keyword, import the employee class you created in classes module
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Define employee_operations
  </summary>

  - For now place the keyword pass
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Define function file_to_dictionary()
  </summary>
  
  - It accepts no parameters
  - It returns the employees dictionary
  - In the function body,
    - Check if there is any data in employees.pkl inside the hw07 folder
      - if no data, then return an empty dictionary
    - Using context manager, unpickle the contents of the file employees.pkl to a dictionary and store in a variable of your choice
    ‚è© Refer to 9-11
    - Print this dictionary and check contents (you may comment it out after)
    - Return this dictionary
</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Modify employee_operations() function
  </summary>
  
  - Call the file_to_dictionary() after the pass statement
  - Print the returned dictionary
  - üìú Execute your code to check if the dictionary is printed correctly, you may use suchi_print
</details>

## In validations.py

<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Define get_next_empid_dict() function
  </summary>
  
  Parameters: Dictionary<br>
  Returns: Integer<br>
  Description: This functions finds the max employee ID in the dictionary and adds 1 to it and returns the next employee ID in a integer format<br>

<details>
  <summary>
    üîë Code Logic:
  </summary>

  - If dictionary is empty, return 1234 (integer, not a string)
  - Get the dictionary keys of the employees dictionary and store in a variable ‚è© Refer to 9-9f
  - Get the max element from that ‚è© Refer to 7-15
  - Add 1 to the max key and return it
</details>

</details>

## In dict_functions.py

<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Define add_employee() function
  </summary>

Parameters: Dictionary  
Returns: Dictionary  
Description: We add a new employee to the dictionary and return the modified dictionary.

<details>
  <summary>
    üîë Code Logic:
  </summary> 

  - Employee ID is obtained from function call to get_next_employeeid() 
  - Name is obtained from function calls to validate_first_name() and validate_last_name()  
  - Email is obtained from a function call to generate_email()
  - Department is obtained from a function call to validate_dept()
  - Salary is obtained from a function call to validate_salary()
  - Using all these values create a dictionary named `new_employee` with the  key/value pairs  
  "name" -> Name  
  "dept" -> Department  
  "email" -> Email  
  "salary" -> Salary

  - Now, to the employees dictionary add a new key/value pair
    - key is the calculated employee ID and
    - value is new_employee dictionary
    - ‚è© Refer to 9-4a
  - Print `Added Employee`
  - Return employees dictionary
</details>

</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Call add_employee()
  </summary>
  
  - In employee_operations() function, after the file_to_dictionary() call add_employee() by passing employees as the argument
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Define lookup_employee()
  </summary>

  Parameters: Dictionary, Integer - (employee dictionary, employee_id)  
  Returns: Boolean (True if employee is found, False if not found)  
  Description: We check if the employee ID is present in the employee dictionary and if found, print all the available data elements for that employee in a pretty format like this  
Name: Mia Rose  
Department: CINS  
Email: mia@company.com  
Salary: 45000

<details>
  <summary>
    üîë Code Logic:
  </summary> 

  - Convert the user provided employee ID to integer (this might raise exception if user enteres non-numeric values, so use exception handling)
  - Using in operator check if the employee ID is in the dictionary   ‚è© Refer to 9-6c
  - If yes,
    - print the name, department, email and salary
    - return True
  - Else
    - print `Employee Not Found`
    - return False

üö© Important: Before you print each data element, make sure that key exists for that employee. ‚è© Refer to 9-6c or use the get method with the second parameter
</details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Call lookup_employee() after add_employee()
  </summary>

  - Get user input for the employee ID that needs to be looked up
  - Call lookup_employee with the employees dictionary and the above employee ID as arguments
  - Test your code with the most recently added employee
</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    ‚úÖ Define function modify_name()

  - if found is true
    - we ask the user to give us a valid name using a call to the validate_first_name and validate_last_name functions
    - Then we find the appropriate dictionary element and modify it  ‚è© Refer to 9-4a
    - üö© Do not forget to change the employee id to integer
    - Print `Name Modified Successfully`
  - Outside if block, return the employees
</details>
